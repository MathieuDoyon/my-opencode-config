  Analyze if end users discover clear value. Use when evaluating product concepts, analyzing adoption, or uncertain about direction.
---

This skill provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating whether end users can "know" what value they'll achieve through a product. It combines analytical methods with decision-making guidance to help you assess product ideas, identify improvement opportunities, and take action.

**What this skill provides**:
- Four-dimension analysis framework (Clarity, Timeline, Perception, Discovery)
- Assessment rubrics for each dimension with scoring guidance
- Decision framework for taking action based on analysis
- B2B/B2E enterprise context guidance
- Prioritization guidance for different product types
- User segmentation by journey stage and persona
- Success criteria and actionable outputs

**Core question**: Can end users clearly understand what value they'll achieve through the product - even if that value takes time to achieve?

**Key terminology**:
- **User**: You (product creator, PM, designer, entrepreneur, etc.)
- **End user**: The person who will use the product being discussed
- **Value**: The outcomes end users achieve (identity, financial gain, capability, time savings, etc.)
- **Features**: The product's technical capabilities

**Core distinction**: Features are not value - features are what the product can do, value is what end users achieve.

## Analysis Framework: Four Dimensions

When analyzing a product idea, evaluate these four dimensions systematically:

### Dimension 1: Value Clarity

**Examine**: Can end users articulate what they'll achieve?

**Why it matters**: End users won't adopt a product if they can't explain to themselves (or others) why they're using it.

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Dropbox**: "Access my files from any device" (clear outcome)
- ❌ **Google Wave**: "Unified communication" (vague, abstract)

**Analysis method**: Ask "What would an end user say when asked 'Why are you using this?'" If the answer is unclear or feature-focused, the value clarity is weak.

**Assessment Rubric**:

| Score | Criteria | Description |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| 🔴 **1** | Fragmented | End users cannot explain what they'll achieve; describe features only |
| 🟡 **2** | Partial | End users can explain but struggle to communicate to others; vague wording |
| 🟢 **3** | Clear | End users clearly articulate what they'll achieve; can explain to others |
| 🟢 **4** | Crisp | End users describe value in one concrete sentence anyone understands |

**Improvement actions** (if 🔴 or 🟡):
- Translate technical features into concrete outcomes
- Use specific examples: "Instead of X, get Y"
- Test with "5-second test": Show value prop, measure comprehension

### Dimension 2: Value Timeline

**Examine**: Is value immediate or delayed? What's the appropriate timeline for this product?

**Why it matters**: Both short-term and long-term value are valid approaches. Choice depends on product nature and end user context.

**Three design options** (all are valid):

| Approach | Best For | Examples |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| **Pure short-term** | Tool-type products, utility apps | Zoom (join meeting), Stripe (test payment) |
| **Pure long-term** | Transformational goals, committed users | Fitness apps (body change), Investment apps (wealth building) |
| **Hybrid** | Long-term goal requiring engagement | Duolingo (fluency with streaks, XP) |

**Analysis method**: Identify primary value timeline. Is immediate feedback needed, or are end users committed to a journey?

**Assessment Rubric**:

| Score | Criteria | Description |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| 🔴 **1** | Mismatched | Timeline conflicts with end user expectations (e.g., long-term product marketed as immediate) |
| 🟡 **2** | Unclear | Timeline undefined; end users don't know when to expect value |
| 🟢 **3** | Aligned | Timeline matches product nature and end user expectations |
| 🟢 **4** | Optimized | Timeline intentionally designed with engaging touchpoints |

**Improvement actions** (if 🔴 or 🟡):
- For long-term products: Add onboarding goals, progress indicators, milestone celebrations
- For short-term products: Ensure complete value delivery is immediate (no hidden barriers)
- Test timeline expectations with target users

### Dimension 3: Value Perception

**Examine**: Can end users see/feel what they achieved?

**Why it matters**: Invisible value feels like no value. Progress must be perceivable.

**Perceivable forms vary by product type**:
- **Consumer apps**: Visual feedback (file appears, photo enhanced)
- **Enterprise software**: Reports, dashboards, metrics, analytics
- **Developer tools**: Build outputs, test results, performance data

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Visible outcomes**: File sync status (Dropbox), likes count (Instagram), contribution graph (GitHub)
- ❌ **Invisible outcomes**: "Your data is synced", "Security improved", "Algorithm optimized"

**Analysis method**: Identify what end users can point to and say "I achieved this." If value is invisible, explore tangibility methods.

**Assessment Rubric**:

| Score | Criteria | Description |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| 🔴 **1** | Invisible | End users cannot see any evidence of value; changes are completely abstract |
| 🟡 **2** | Opaque | Value delivered but not shown; requires digging to find evidence |
| 🟢 **3** | Visible | End users can see progress; value has tangible manifestations |
| 🟢 **4** | Salient | Value is prominently displayed; end users are constantly reminded of achievements |

**Improvement actions** (if 🔴 or 🟡):
- Add progress indicators, dashboards, or visualizations
- Send notifications when value is delivered ("X completed!")
- Create shareable achievements for social proof

### Dimension 4: Value Discovery

**Examine**: Do end users already know they want this, or will they discover it through use?

**Why it matters**: Sometimes end users don't know what they want until they experience it. The product must enable rapid discovery.

**Discovery patterns**:
- ✅ **Instagram**: End users thought they wanted "share photos", discovered they valued "become a photographer" (identity)
- ✅ **Notion**: End users thought they wanted "take notes", discovered they valued "become organized" (identity)

**Analysis method**: Determine whether end users already know what they want, or need to discover it. If discovery needed, identify fastest path to "aha moment."

**Assessment Rubric**:

| Score | Criteria | Description |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| 🔴 **1** | No path | Discovery possible but no clear onboarding; end users struggle to find value |
| 🟡 **2** | Slow path | Aha moment exists but takes too long (weeks/months) to reach |
| 🟢 **3** | Fast path | Most end users discover value within first session |
| 🟢 **4** | Accelerated | Discovery actively guided through tutorial, onboarding, or progressive revelation |

**Improvement actions** (if 🔴 or 🟡):
- Map the "aha moment" journey from signup to value realization
- Remove friction points delaying discovery
- Add guided tours, templates, or examples demonstrating value

## Prioritization Framework: Which Dimensions Matter Most?

Different product types require focusing on different dimensions. Use this guidance to prioritize:

### Product Type Matrix

| Product Type | Clarity | Timeline | Perception | Discovery | Notes |
| ------------ | ------- | -------- | ---------- | --------- | ----- |
| **Social apps** | High | Medium | Medium | High | Identity discovery critical |
| **Productivity tools** | High | High | High | Medium | Utility must be immediate and visible |
| **Infrastructure/Dev tools** | Medium | High | High | Medium | Perception > Clarity (technical users) |
| **Gaming/Entertainment** | Medium | High | High | High | Engagement loops matter |
| **Enterprise B2B** | Medium | Medium | High | Low | Decision-maker evaluation different |
| **Marketplaces/Platforms** | High | High | Medium | Medium | Trust signals and outcomes |

### Scoring Trade-offs

When one dimension scores low, consider whether other dimensions compensate:

**Can compensate**:
- 🔴 Low Clarity + 🟢 High Discovery → Product may work through discovery
- 🔴 Low Perception + 🟢 High Clarity → End users may stay despite invisible value

**Cannot compensate**:
- 🔴 Timeline Mismatch → If timeline fails expectations, product will struggle regardless of other strengths
- 🔴 Low Perception in visual product → Consumer apps with invisible value rarely succeed

### Decision Framework: From Analysis to Action

After completing the four-dimension analysis, use this framework to determine next actions.

---

## Consumer Product Decision Guide

### Scenario A: Overall Score 1.0-1.8 (Critical)

**Diagnosis**: Product has fundamental value realization problems

**Required actions**:
1. **Stop**, don't build yet
2. Re-examine core problem: Are you addressing a real end user need?
3. Pivot: Can you reframe features as concrete outcomes?
4. Test: Value proposition testing with target users before proceeding

**Decision tree**:
```
Can you explain the value in one sentence?
    |
    +-- No → Reframe the entire product concept
    |
    +-- Yes → Proceed to Scenario B analysis
```

### Scenario B: Overall Score 2.0-2.8 (Needs Work)

**Diagnosis**: Product has potential but needs focused improvements

**Prioritized action order**:

1️⃣ **If Value Clarity is 🔴 or 🟡 (priority #1)**:
   - Action: Rewrite value propositions using "outcome, not feature" framing
   - Test: Run 5-second tests with 10 target users
   - Success: 80%+ can explain the value

2️⃣ **If Value Timeline is unmatched (priority #2)**:
   - Action: Align timeline with end user expectations
   - For long-term products: Add immediate onboarding goals
   - For short-term products: Remove barriers to first value delivery

3️⃣ **If Value Perception is 🔴 or 🟡 (priority #3)**:
   - Action: Make progress visible
   - Add: Dashboards, notifications, progress indicators
   - Create: Shareable achievements, before/after comparisons

4️⃣ **If Value Discovery is 🔴 or 🟡 (priority #4)**:
   - Action: Accelerate time-to-aha
   - Map: User journey from signup to value realization
   - Reduce: Steps, clicks, or time to first value experience

**When to iterate vs. when to rebuild**:
- Iterate with 2-3 dimensions weak → Focused improvements
- Rebuild with all dimensions weak → Fundamental conceptual issues

### Scenario C: Overall Score 3.0-3.5 (Good)

**Diagnosis**: Product has solid foundation; focus on optimization

**Action priorities**:
- Strength reinforcement: Double down on highest-scoring dimensions
- Weakness mitigation: Elevate low scores from 2 to 3
- A/B testing: Test different messaging, onboarding flows

**When ship**:
- All dimensions ≥ 3 (green)
- At least one dimension = 4 (excellent)
- End user interviews confirm value understanding

### Scenario D: Overall Score 3.6-4.0 (Excellent)

**Diagnosis**: Product is well-positioned

**Action priorities**:
- Monitor: Track metrics for regression
- Scale: Focus on growth, distribution, awareness
- Refine: Small optimizations only; don't break what works

## B2B/B2E Enterprise Framework

Enterprise products differ: Decision-makers ≠ End Users. Use this complementary approach.

### Enterprise Analysis Framework

#### Buyer Analysis (Decision-Maker Criteria)

**Analyze using 5 dimensions**:

| Dimension | Question | Examples |
| --------- | -------- | -------- |
| **ROI Clarity** | Can buyers calculate return? | Cost savings, productivity gains, revenue impact |
| **Risk Mitigation** | Is risk addressed upfront? | Security certifications, compliance, SLAs |
| **Technical Fit** | Does it integrate? | API docs, integration examples, tech stack match |
| **Vendor Trust** | Why trust this solution? | Customer logos, case studies, established company |
| **Adoption Path** | How will end users actually use it? | Training docs, onboarding, support plan |

**Assessment Rubric for Buyer Value**:

| Score | Criteria | Action |
| ----- | -------- | ------ |
| 🔴 **1** | None | Buyers cannot evaluate business case; need ROI calculator, case studies |
| 🟡 **2** | Partial | ROI unclear or unverifiable; add before/after metrics, testimonials |
| 🟢 **3** | Clear | Buyers can calculate ROI; case studies demonstrate value |
| 🟢 **4** | Compelling | Irresistible business case with verifiable metrics |

#### End User Analysis (Same 4 Dimensions Apply)

Same framework as consumer products, applied to end users (not buyers):

1️⃣ **Value Clarity (for end users, not buyers)**: Can employees explain what they'll achieve?
2️⃣ **Value Timeline**: Will they see immediate productivity gains or is training required?
3️⃣ **Value Perception**: Can managers see productivity improvements in reports?
4️⃣ **Value Discovery**: Will the learning curve accelerate or impede adoption?

### Enterprise Decision Guide

| Scenario | Buyer Analysis | End User Analysis | Action |
| -------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| Buyer 🔴, End User 🟢 | Weak | Strong | Build sales collateral; fix business case pitch |
| Buyer 🟢, End User 🔴 | Strong | Weak | Improve product UX; simplify onboarding for employees |
| Both weak | 🔴 | 🔴 | Fundamental problem; rethink market or product |
| Both good | 🟢 | 🟢 | Proceed to market with confidence |

**Key distinctions**:
- Consumer products: End users = buyers; single analysis suffices
- Enterprise products: Separate buyer analysis; both must succeed

---

## User Segmentation: Not All Users Are Equal

End users vary by journey stage and persona. Segment analysis to address all.

### Journey Stage Analysis

Map end users through adoption stages:

```
┌──────────┬────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
│          │            │              │              │
│ Onboarding│ Power User │  Retention   │   Advocacy   │
│  (Day 0-7)│ (Month 1+)│ (Month 3+)   │ (Month 6+)   │
│          │            │              │              │
│ Questions│ Advanced │ Value Re-enforcement│Social Proof&│
│: "Can I? "│   Use    │: "Is this   │ Recognition   │
│          │   : "What │  still worth │ Sharing      │
│          │    else?" │  it?"        │              │
└──────────┴────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

**For each stage, evaluate**:

| Stage | Key Questions | Value Clarity | Value Perception | Value Discovery |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| **Onboarding** | "Can I use this?" | 🔴/🟡 is fatal | Must see immediate progress | Tutorial reduces discovery time |
| **Power User** | "What else can I do?" | Advanced features need clarity | Show expertise level usage | Hidden features become visible |
| **Retention** | "Is this still worth it?" | Reaffirm ongoing value | Long-term progress visible | New discoveries maintain interest |
| **Advocacy** | "Can I recommend this?" | Crisp for sharing | Shareable achievements | Others discover through them |

### Persona Analysis

Different personas have different value expectations:

**Example for Developer Tool**:

| Persona | Primary Job | Value Priorities |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| **Junior Dev** | Learn quickly, impress team | Tutorial clarity, quick wins, error safety |
| **Senior Dev** | Ship faster, less friction | Performance, reliability, API elegance |
| **CTO/VP** | Evaluate team efficiency | Team metrics, cost management, security |

**Action**: For each dimension, evaluate for multiple personas, not just one.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall 1: One-Dimension Fixes

**Mistake**: Fixing only one dimension (e.g., clarity) and ignoring others.

**Reality**: Weak perception undermines even excellent clarity.

**Avoid**: Always evaluate all four dimensions. Trade-offs are OK, but ignoring dimensions is not.

### Pitfall 2: Feature-Centric Messaging

**Mistake**: Listing features instead of outcomes.

**Reality**: End users don't care about "X feature," they care about "achieve Y."

**Avoid**: Use "feature name → end user outcome" mapping for all messaging.

### Pitfall 3: Timeline Mismatch

**Mistake**: Long-term product marketed as immediate (or vice versa).

**Reality**: Timeline mismatch creates end user frustration and churn.

**Avoid**: Clearly communicate timeline. If long-term, explain what short-term touchpoints exist.

### Pitfall 4: Invisible Value

**Mistake**: Delivering great value that end users can't see.

**Reality**: Invisible = no value in end user perception.

**Avoid**: Always ask "Can end users point to something and say 'I achieved this'?"

### Pitfall 5: Ignoring Discovery Path

**Mistake**: Assuming end users will "figure it out."

**Reality**: Most won't take time to discover value through trial and error.

**Avoid**: Explicitly design the "aha moment" journey from signup to realization.

### Pitfall 6: B2B Focusing Only on Buyers

**Mistake**: Enterprise products that sell to CIOs but fail with end users.

**Reality**: If employees won't use it, the deal won't renew.

**Avoid**: Separate buyer analysis from end user analysis; both must succeed.

## Research Methodology

### Verification Practices

When citing product cases:
- ✅ Use official sources (product websites, company blogs, published metrics)
- ✅ Explain relevance to current product context
- ❌ Avoid relying on memory or generalizations
- ⚠️ When data unavailable, proceed with framework and note verification needed

### Cross-Context Validity

Reference cases illustrate patterns, not universal rules.

**Assess applicability**:
- Product type match (consumer vs b2b vs enterprise)
- Market context match (competitive vs niche vs monopoly)
- User behavior match (daily vs episodic vs one-time)
- Value delivery match (immediate vs long-term vs hybrid)

**Don't apply**: Instagram patterns to infrastructure tools, or Duolingo patterns to B2B software.

**Do apply**: Search for comparable products in your domain and analyze those instead.

## Real-World Patterns (Not Rules)

### Success Stories

**Dropbox**:
- Value Clarity 4/4: "Access files from any device"
- Timeline 4/4: Immediate (< 5 minutes)
- Perception 4/4: File visibly appears
- Discovery 3/4: Intuitive, no onboarding friction

**Duolingo**:
- Value Clarity 3/4: "Learn a language" (clear)
- Timeline 3/4: Long-term goal (fluency 6-12 months) with short-term touchpoints (streaks, XP)
- Perception 4/4: Daily streaks, XP, levels
- Discovery 3/4: Gamified onboarding

**Instagram**:
- Value Clarity 2/4 (initially) → 4/4 (evolved): "Share photos" → "Become a photographer" (identity)
- Timeline 3/4: Immediate (share) + long-term (build following)
- Perception 4/4: Likes, followers shareable
- Discovery 4/4: Filters, social validation enable "aha"

### Failure Stories

**Google Wave**:
- Value Clarity 1/4: "Unified communication" (abstract)
- Timeline 2/4: Unclear when value would occur
- Perception 2/4: Value delivered but invisible
- Discovery 1/4: No clear "aha moment"
- Result: Shut down 14 months after launch

**Quibi**:
- Value Clarity 1/4: "10-minute videos on mobile" (not recognized value)
- Timeline 3/4: Immediate (but wrong value proposition)
- Perception 3/4: Visible content
- Discovery 2/4: Users knew what it was but didn't want it
- Result: $1.75B funding, shut down in 6 months

## How to Use This Skill

### When to Engage

Trigger this skill when:
- Discussing product ideas or features
- Evaluating "is this idea good?"
- Analyzing adoption or retention problems
- Planning marketing or positioning strategy
- Uncertain about product direction

### Engagement Process

1. **Identify end users** - Who will use the product?
2. **Complete four-dimension analysis** - Evaluate clarity, timeline, perception, discovery
3. **Determine product type** - Consumer, B2B, enterprise?
4. **Apply scoring and decision framework** - Score → Identify priorities → Plan actions
5. **Document findings** - Summary, decisions, action plan

### Key Principles

1. **End users must "know" what value they'll achieve** - even if delayed
2. **Value types are diverse** - identity, money, benefits, status, capability, and more
3. **End users often don't know what they want** - help them discover it
4. **Perception matters** - invisible value = no value
5. **Context is everything** - patterns from one product may not apply to others
6. **Both short-term and long-term are valid** - neither superior, choose based on product nature
7. **Test with real end users** - don't assume
8. **Score all dimensions** - trade-offs OK, ignoring dimensions not

## Remember

This skill helps analyze and make decisions, not prescribe solutions. Every product is unique. Every market is different. The goal: discover whether end users will clearly understand what they'll achieve - because that understanding drives adoption.

**When in doubt**: Test with real end users. Framework guides thinking; reality validates it.
